**Project Title: ChatBot with Natural Language Processing**

**Description:**
This project implements a ChatBot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It allows users to interact with the ChatBot using text input, and the ChatBot responds with appropriate messages generated based on the input.

**Key Features:**
- **Intent Recognition:** Utilizes NLP to recognize the intent behind user messages.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration:** Incorporates a text-to-speech library for spoken responses.
- **Training Data Handling:** Loads and preprocesses training data from JSON and binary files.
- **Neural Network Model:** Implements a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras for intent prediction.
- **Interactive Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the ChatBot.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Train the model using the provided training data.
3. Run the ChatBot script.
4. Interact with the ChatBot by entering text messages.

**Dependencies:**
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Speak (Text-to-Speech library)
